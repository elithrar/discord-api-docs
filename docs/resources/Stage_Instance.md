# Stage Instance Resource

A _Stage Instance_ holds information about a live stage.

## Definitions

Below are some definitions related to stages.

- **Liveness:** A Stage channel is considered _live_ when there is an associated stage instance. Conversely, a Stage channel is _not live_ when there is no associated stage instance.
- **Speakers:** A participant of a Stage channel is a _speaker_ when their [voice state](#DOCS_RESOURCES_VOICE/voice-state-object)
  is not `suppress`ed, and has no `request_to_speak_timestamp`.
- **Moderators**: A member of the guild is a _moderator_ of a Stage channel if they have all of the following [permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions):
  - `MANAGE_CHANNELS`
  - `MUTE_MEMBERS`
  - `MOVE_MEMBERS`
- Topic: This is the blurb that gets shown below the channel's name, among other places.

## Auto Closing

When a Stage channel has no speakers for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes) it will be automatically deleted.
